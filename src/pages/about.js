                <p>
                    I grew up in the suburbs adjacent to the tech centers of Bellevue and Redmond. Having a family
                    history of taking interest in computers, it was natural that I too would as well. From a young
                    age, probably elementary school I began taking apart computers or various electronics (with
                    intermittent success putting them back together). After the impactful 2010 release of Tron: Legacy, it
                    was pretty much set that computers would become my career path.

                    Throughout much of middle school and highschool, programming, scripting and gaming constituted for much
                    of my time. I remember my friends and I making many strange projects using breadboards and microcontrollers,
                    when we weren't playing either Counter Strike or Halo. For the latter part of highschool I attended Summer
                    and Fall workshops at DigiPen institute covering things like web development, cyber-security, AI and robotics,
                    and even sound engineering.

                    After highschool, I attended Bellevue College where I learned perseverance, ultimately earning my Associates in Science
                    amidst the height of the Coronavirus Pandemic. After graduation, I quickly moved to Tucson, Arizona to further my 
                    education, currently working on a Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Arizona. When not in classes, 
                    I serve as a web developer for the university's bookstore and student union.
